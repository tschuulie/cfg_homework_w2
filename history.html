            <h2>History of Icelandic Sheepdogs</h2>
            <p>Iceland was settled in the late 9th century A.D. by Nordic people. These early settlers brought sheep, horses, and the ancestors of the Icelandic Sheepdog, Iceland‚Äôs only native breed. Over the centuries, these dogs adapted to the harsh terrain and the needs of Icelandic farmers and shepherds. By the early 20th century, however, farming in Iceland declined and the number of Icelandic Sheepdogs was so drastically reduced that the breed was in danger of extinction.</p> 
            <p>In recent years, efforts by Icelandic and international breeders have increased the numbers, particularly in Iceland, where this working breed has become newly popular as a family companion. The Icelandic Sheepdog was recognized by the AKC in 2010.</p>

        <h2>Organized Breeding</h2>
        <p>P√°ll A. P√°lsson was among the first people to realize that the Icelandic Sheepdog was facing extinction, and he 
        arranged to breed the female he had kept at the Keldur clinic. Organized breeding was also funded by the Ministry 
        of Agriculture at the town of Hverager√∞i (Deild √≠slenska fj√°rhundsins [D√çF], 2005).  </p>
        
        <p>In 1967, Sigr√≠√∞ur P√©tursd√≥ttir started a substantial breeding program at the farm √ìlafsvellir in Skei√∞ahreppur, in 
        cooperation with P√°ll A. P√°lsson. Sigr√≠√∞ur worked with Mark Watson and other breeders in England, who 
        provided her with invaluable assistance and information. Because Sigri√∞ur‚Äôs first dogs were too closely related to 
        continue breeding, she obtained permission to import two puppies from Mark Watson in England, since the 
        breeding stock in Iceland was very poor at that time.</p> 
        
        <p>With these few dogs, Sigr√≠√∞ur started her pioneering work in breeding the Icelandic sheepdog (Same source; G√≠sli 
        P√°lsson 1999:8-9). In 1969, the Icelandic Kennel Club (HRF√ç) was established, and one of its goals was to 
        protect and advance the breeding of the Icelandic Sheepdog. Eventually the club became a member of the 
        F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) and the Nordic Kennel Union (NKU).</p> 
        
        <p>Today, the Icelandic Kennel Club is an umbrella organization for owners and amateur breeders of many different 
        breeds, but the Icelandic Sheepdog breed club is still the largest in the organization (Same source:9; 
        Hundar√¶ktarf√©lag √çslands [HRF√ç], 2005).</p>
        
        <p>The Icelandic breed club, D√çF, was established in 1979. Its mission is the protection and advancement of the 
        breed under the auspices of the Icelandic Kennel Club (HRF√ç). In 1996, the president of HRF√ç, Gu√∞r√∫n R. 
        Gu√∞johnsen, initiated the foundation of the Icelandic Sheepdog International Cooperation (ISIC) in order to 
        encourage cooperation among countries in preserving the Icelandic Sheepdog. The ISIC member clubs within FCI 
        are Iceland - De√≠ld √çslenska Fj√°rhundsins / D√çF, Denmark - Islandsk F√•rehundeklub / IF, Sweden - Svenska 
        Isl√§ndsk F√•rhund Klubben / SIFK, Norway ‚Äì Norsk Islandshundklub / NIHK, Finland ‚Äì Islanninkoirat / 
        Islandshundarna, Netherlands ‚Äì Vereniging de Ijslandse Hond, and Germany ‚Äì Deutsche Club f√ºr Nordishe 
        Hunde/DCNH. The other ISIC member club is the USA - Icelandic Sheepdog Association of America/ISAA, the 
        AKC Parent Club for the breed. An ISIC associated club within FCI is Switzerland ‚Äì Schweizerischer Klub f√ºr 
        Nordische Hunde/SKNH also called Islandhundeclub Schweiz. [ISIC Newsletter, 2010]</p> 
        
        <p>The popularity of the Icelandic Sheepdog has increased in recent years. Though the breed is not common, it is not 
        in immediate danger of becoming extinct. (Deild √≠slenska fj√°rhundsins 2005, [D√çF]).</p>
